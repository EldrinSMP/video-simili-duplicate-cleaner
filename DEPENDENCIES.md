# OpenCV

To build opencv, first follow :
- https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/db2/tutorial_macos_install.html
- We want a custom install directory to get all the dependencies in one place so use the cmake flag ```-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/theophanemayaud/Dev/opencv_install```
- If wanting static libraries use flag -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF

In the end the cmake command looks like : ```cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Users/theophanemayaud/Dev/opencv_install -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ../opencv```

You should now have in the ```/Users/theophanemayaud/Dev/opencv_install``` folder all the library files and includes.

Then run ```make```, then run ```make install```
